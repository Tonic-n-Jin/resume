Dear Hiring Manager,  

I am applying for the Data Engineer position at Camelot Integrated Solutions Inc. The role’s emphasis on developing reliable data pipelines and analytics-ready models using Snowflake, orchestration tools like Airflow, dbt, SQL, and Python closely aligns with my experience leading analytics engineering initiatives that deliver governed, trusted data assets for confident business consumption and utilization.

ELT/ETL Pipelines & Orchestration: I architected and deployed an enterprise-level medallion architecture with cloud-based ELT pipelines on AWS for PSA BDP. Leveraging SQL Server OLTP databases and Qlik Talend for change data capture (CDC), I implemented Snowflake pipelines orchestrated through Prefect—experience that translates directly to modern orchestration patterns used in Airflow-style workflows.

Expert SQL & Analytics Enablement: With more than eight years of SQL experience, I have delivered 300+ production stored procedures and optimized queries that operationalized business logic into reusable, analytics-ready transformations—powering curated dimensional outputs and consistent KPI definitions for reporting and downstream BI consumption.

Data Warehousing & Modeling: Over eight years, I have implemented star, snowflake, and galaxy schemas across traditional and modern data technologies, tailoring designs to business requirements. I collaborated with key stakeholders to migrate an on-premises Oracle Operational Data Store into a cloud-based Enterprise Data Warehouse utilizing AWS for storage, Snowflake for compute, and dbt to implement medallion-layered marts.

Data Governance & CI/CD: I have one year of focused self-study in data management frameworks (DAMA-DMBOK, DGI, CMMI DMM), and I apply these principles directly through my design decisions—driving standards for testing, documentation, version control, and repeatable delivery. Complementing this, I bring more than four years of hands-on experience implementing CI/CD using GitHub Actions and dbt’s native capabilities.

Performance Tuning: I reduced enterprise OLAP query latency by 88% by overhauling enterprise BI data marts through a lambda-style architecture, combining Python and SQL Server optimizations with downstream semantic-layer improvements across the Qlik Sense environment (including scripting and scheduling via native platform capabilities).

Collaboration & Communication: I have a proven record of partnering with C-suite executives and cross-functional teams to align technology investments with strategic business objectives. Through collaborations with colleagues at PwC, Accenture, and PSA, I have incorporated industry best practices to consistently deliver high-quality data assets and downstream solutions.

I would welcome the opportunity to contribute to Camelot Integrated Solutions Inc. by developing scalable, analytics-ready data products that effectively bridge technical execution and tangible business outcomes.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my background can support your team’s objectives.

Sincerely,  
Kyle Jovanovic
