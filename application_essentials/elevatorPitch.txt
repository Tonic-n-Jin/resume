Hey Kyle! Your current pitch is strong structurally, but it reads as generic — it could apply to any senior DE role. The big opportunity here is **connecting your experience directly to their mission and stack**.

A few specific callouts before I draft:

1. **Your LCHB and CSCP certifications are gold here** — customs brokerage is a heavily regulated data environment with strict compliance/accuracy requirements. That maps directly to their "bonus: regulated data environments" qualifier and the broader pharma compliance mindset.
2. **Name their stack** — they mention Dagster/Prefect/Airflow, dbt, Snowflake, metadata/observability explicitly. You have direct experience with most of these.
3. **Tie to the mission** — they're accelerating drug development. Your pitch should signal you understand *why* clean, trustworthy data matters in that context.

Here's a tightened version:

You need me on your team for three reasons: I bring the technical depth this platform requires, I've built my career translating business complexity into trusted data, and I lead by enabling the people around me.**

Firstly, I am an experienced leader in a production environment with your exact stack.
I bring 8+ years designing and delivering enterprise data products with deep hands-on strength in Python, expert-level SQL, dbt, and Snowflake — including migrating 300+ stored procedures to Snowflake, deploying Snowpark UDFs for standardized transformations, and building CI/CD-automated dbt projects that cut analytics delivery time by 40%. I'm comfortable with orchestration (Airflow, Prefect), ingestion from APIs and cloud storage, and I prioritize metadata, observability, and testing as first-class concerns — not afterthoughts.

Secondly, I have only worked in heavily regulated data environments which required close partnerships with many different departments/individuals.
As a Licensed Customs House Broker and Certified Supply Chain Professional, I've spent years operating in compliance-driven environments where data accuracy requirements ranged from 95% to 99.97% — contractually enforced. I know what it means to build data assets people can trust when the stakes are high. I partner directly with operations, finance, and executive stakeholders to turn ambiguous goals into phased delivery roadmaps, and I communicate fluently across technical and non-technical audiences.

Lastly, I pride myself on being the "go-to" engineer who strives to elevate the entire team through transparency and collaboration.
I've managed and mentored teams of up to 15, coaching engineers on SQL best practices and scalable design patterns while driving cross-functional alignment across technology, operations, and business units. I'm energized by removing blockers, setting quality standards, and building the kind of data platform where pipelines are clean, data is discoverable, and downstream consumers — whether analysts, operators, or product teams — can move with confidence. Accelerating drug development demands exactly that kind of trust in the data layer, and I'm excited to help build it.

Key changes from your original:
- **Specifics over adjectives** — replaced phrases like "modern stack fluency" with actual tools and measurable outcomes
- **Regulated data angle** — elevated your LCHB/CSCP as direct evidence of working in compliance-heavy environments (pharma people will immediately connect with this)
- **Mirrored their language** — "discoverable," "observability," "metadata," "testing," "trustworthy" all come from the JD
- **Closed with their mission** — the final sentence ties your value to accelerating drug development
